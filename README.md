## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **\Subhash**, a passionate and driven **Software Developer** focused on building elegant, efficient, and scalable digital solutions. With a deep interest in **R\&D**, I love working on systems that blend technical depth with real-world impact — from custom frameworks to design engines and productivity tools.



## 💼 What I Do

🔧 **Custom Frameworks & Tools**
I'm currently developing **Zira**, a custom PHP framework that supports:

* Dependency Injection with auto-binding (via interface scanning)
* Controller auto-wiring
* Modular routing with middleware
* Twig templating and RedBean ORM integration
  This forms the backbone of a larger goal — recreating Zoho-like SaaS modules in a modular, extensible architecture.

🧠 **R\&D Projects**
I actively work on research-driven projects, including:

* A **Sketch-inspired Design Engine** using Next.js, TypeScript, Fabric.js, and shadcn/ui
* A **Solo Leveling-inspired Mobile Task Manager** in React Native that turns personal goals into RPG-style quests and stats

🛠 **Web & App Development**

* Frontend focus: TypeScript, React/Next.js, TailwindCSS
* Backend: PHP (Zira Framework), Laravel, Ruby
* Tooling: Git, Linux, Markdown, Obsidian for PKM
* Design: Photoshop, UI/UX prototyping



## 📌 Goals

* ✅ Build a flexible and modular design suite for digital creators
* 🚀 Develop and monetize productivity + business tools
* 📚 Continue mastering software architecture, design patterns, and scalable systems
* 🛠 Contribute to open-source and share R\&D experiments
